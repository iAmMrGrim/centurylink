# centurylink
I HAVE ONLY DONE THIS WITH A CENTURYLINK MODEM

legal disclaimer:
This is theft and fraud. I will not be responsible
For how you uae it. This is an attempt to get 
the information to centurylink because 
I made every attempt possible (and some) to 
to contact centurylink and share this information
they seem to not care and they were quite rude
to me.

Doing this for three months gave me NO bill

When i altered it 

I got a letter saying welcome to centurylink
They are currently not aware that i have been
a customer for 10 months.
